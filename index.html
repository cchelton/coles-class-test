    <h1>My JS class test</h1>
    <p>
      I wanted to try to make a class counter that incremented whenever a new
      class object was constructed. This is what I came up with. See test.js
    </p>
    <p>There are 3 classes</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Vehicle: Parent class, increments whenever a Vehicle, Bike or Car is
        constructed
      </li>
      <li>
        Bike: Extends from Vehicle. Has its own counter but increments Vehicles
        as well
      </li>
      <li>Car: Same as Vehicle</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      All 3 classes have a static field that can be referenced, saving me the
      time of writing a getter method for the count
    </p>
